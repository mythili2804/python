Welcome to my Python repository! 🚀 This space is where I document my learning journey by building small Python projects. As a beginner, I'm exploring different concepts and improving my coding skills one project at a time.

### 🎮 Project 1: Guess The Number  
- This project is a beginner-friendly game where I explore loops and conditional statements in Python.
