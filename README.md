# 🐍 My Python Projects  

Welcome to my Python repository! 🚀 This space is where I document my learning journey by building small Python projects. As a beginner, I'm exploring different concepts and improving my coding skills one project at a time. 

### 🎮 Project 1:  Guess The Number  
- This project is a beginner-friendly game where I explore loops and conditional statements in Python.  
- The game involves user interaction and decision-making based on conditions.  
- Stay tuned for updates and improvements!
### 🔄 Project 2: Break, Continue, Pass in Action
- This project demonstrates the use of break, continue, and pass within a number-guessing game.
- It includes input validation, loop control, and decision-making logic for better understanding of flow control.
- A fun and interactive way to practice handling user input and controlling program execution!
